# Final-Project-DataScienceProgramming
A GitHub Repository for my final project in my Data Science Programming Class

Each of the files represents a different milestone within the project. Each milestone adds onto the code following different directions for each part.

Milestone 2:

Begin the data analysis process of your final project by collecting your data and doing some initial exploratory analysis.

If your dataset is small enough, you may want to open it in MS Excel or Google Sheets first to view what the data looks like.
Using a Jupyter Notebook, import the data into a pandas dataframe using the appropriate Python library for the dataset file type.
Explore basic properties of the dataset such as:
describe()
columns
shape
dtypes
head(), tail(), sample()
info()

Milestone 3:

Continue to work on your Final Project. This week's focus is on Data Cleaning.

Here are some questions you should ask yourself about the dataset:

Did your exploratory analysis from last week highlight anything that needs to be cleaned?
Investigate any NaN's that you find. Should these be replaced with another value? If so, what would be the best value? Should that record be deleted instead?
Are there outliers to any of the data items? What could explain those outliers? Should those records be changed or deleted?
Are the column names not in a format that makes it easy to refer to?
Do you need to merge multiple datasets into one?
Do you need to split up a column's data into multiple columns or simplify its values?

Milestone 4:

Now that your data is clean, you can begin your analysis of your dataset.

Perform whatever aggregate functions you need to, in order to answer at least 2 of your questions. State your questions in Markdown cells and show the answer using Python, displaying the result in a plot.
